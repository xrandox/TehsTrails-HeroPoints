# Tehs Trails - Hero Points
This pack contains trails for speed-completing Hero Points either solo or in small groups. The name of the game here is speed, to help you unlock those pesky elite specializations on your alts fast!

## Disclaimer
This pack is specifically tailored to fast SOLO or SMALL-GROUP hero point farming for VETERAN players. It's a bit more on the 'try-hard' side and not intended for your first time doing hero points. Also, if you try to lead a squad through these routes, chances are it will go horribly and half of them will crash or get lost, or just plain not be able to follow.

## Requirements
Again, this is designed for veteran players grinding elite specs for their alts, so the requirements are pretty steep:
- All mounts + mount masteries
- Prototype Position Rewinder
- Jade Waypoint (Don't Forget Your Jade Bot Core!)
- Ash Legion Spy Kits (Optional, but recommended if your class doesn't have access to stealth)

## Tutorial
There is an in-game tutorial should you ever have any questions, most everything you need to know is explained there
